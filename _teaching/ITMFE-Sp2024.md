__Course Description:__

The Introduction to MATLAB for Engineers course is designed to provide students with a basic understanding of MATLAB, a powerful programming language used in various fields such as engineering, science, and mathematics. This course is suitable for beginners as it covers the basics of MATLAB programming, including syntax, data types, and plotting, without any prerequisites. Additionally, the course includes more advanced topics such as the Symbolic Math Toolbox, Curve Fitting, and Simulink. Students will learn how to perform symbolic computations, analyze data with curve fitting techniques, and utilize Simulink for designing and simulating dynamic systems. Through practical exercises and demonstrations, students will develop proficiency in these advanced MATLAB functionalities, enhancing their ability to solve computational problems.

__Course Schedule:__

This course is held by the Scientific Society of Mechanical Engineering at Amirkabir University of Technology and is scheduled to commence on April 18<sup>th</sup>, 2024 and will span over 5 weeks, with classes held every Thursday and Friday from 12:00 to 14:00, totaling 20 hours of instruction.

__Course Format:__

The course will be taught through a combination of lectures and hands-on projects. Students will have access to MATLAB and Simulink software for the duration of the course and will be expected to complete assignments and projects outside of class time.

__Grading Policy:__ 
Students will be assessed through a combination of a final project and a final exam. Grades will be based on the quality of the work submitted.
* Attendance: 10 Points 
* Final Project: 50 points
*	Final Exam: 40 points 

The certificate of attendance will be awarded to all registered students. However, the certificate of achievement will only be granted to those who attain a minimum of 70 points.
