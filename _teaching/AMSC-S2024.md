__Course Description:__

This course is designed for students who already have some experience with MATLAB and Simulink and want to take their skills to the next level. The course will start with a review of the fundamental concepts of MATLAB and Simulink, including basic programming techniques, data structures, and flow control. This course covers a comprehensive array of advanced topics including advanced function creation, plotting techniques, data transfer, object-oriented programming, machine learning, optimization methods, Simulink fundamentals and advanced features, real-time simulation and GUI design using App Designer. Students will gain expertise in utilizing MATLAB and Simulink for complex problem-solving, modeling, and simulation tasks across various engineering disciplines.

__Course Schedule:__

This course is held by the Scientific Association of Mechanical Engineering Department at Amirkabir University of Technology and is scheduled to commence on August 8<sup>th</sup>, 2024 and will span over 6 weeks, with classes held every Thursday and Friday from 17:00 to 19:00, totaling 24 hours of instruction.

__Prerequisites:__

Students are expected to possess a basic understanding of MATLAB and Simulink. Nevertheless, a brief review will be conducted on fundamental concepts.

__Course Format:__

The course will be taught through a combination of lectures and hands-on projects. Students will have access to MATLAB and Simulink software for the duration of the course and will be expected to complete assignments and projects outside of class time.

__Grading Policy:__ 

Students will be assessed through a combination of a final project and a final exam. Grades will be based on the quality of the work submitted.
*	Attendance: 10 Points 
*	Homework: 50 points
*	Final Exam: 40 points

The certificate of attendance will be awarded to all registered students. However, the certificate of achievement will only be granted to those who attain a minimum of 70 points.
