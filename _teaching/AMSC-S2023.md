__Course Description:__

This course is designed for students who already have some experience with MATLAB and Simulink and want to take their skills to the next level. The course will cover advanced programming techniques and their application to aerospace and control engineering problems. The course will start with a review of the fundamental concepts of MATLAB and Simulink, including basic programming techniques, data structures, and control flow. In this course, students will then learn advanced programming techniques, such as advanced approaches to function creation, object-oriented programming, and training neural networks, and will apply these techniques to solve engineering problems in aerospace and control engineering. Students will learn how to use MATLAB and Simulink to model and simulate complex aerospace and control systems and will gain hands-on experience in designing and implementing control algorithms for aerospace systems.

__Course Schedule:__

This course is held by the Student Scientific Society of Aerospace Engineering at Amirkabir University of Technology and is scheduled to commence on August 3<sup>rd, 2023 and will span over 7 weeks, with classes held every Thursday from 14:00 to 18:00, totaling 28 hours of instruction.

__Prerequisites:__
