This diagram highlights the different eras in control systems development, showcasing the key ideas and challenges addressed during each phase. 
As our systems have grown increasingly complex—dealing with variable dynamic characteristics, strong nonlinearities, heavy coupling, unclear mechanisms and mathematically un-modellable—the limitations of existing control theories have become more apparent. This complexity makes modeling a daunting task, underscoring the urgent need for innovative control methods.


The content of the diagram is primarily inspired by concepts from Prof. Ali Khaki-Sedigh’s book, An Introduction to Data-Driven Control Systems (John Wiley & Sons, 2023)
