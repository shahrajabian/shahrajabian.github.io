**Fuzzy Logic Control of a Three-link Gymnastic Robot on Horizontal Bar for Giant Swing Motion**

In this project, we developed a model-free fuzzy logic-based intelligent control system for a nonlinear three-link robotic manipulator, modeled as a gymnastic robot on a horizontal bar to achieve the giant swing motion. The manipulator consists of three links: the first link is the arm, the second link is the body, and the third link is the legs. The system has two active joints and one passive joint (located between the arm—the first link—and the horizontal bar). The dynamics of the robot are based on the work by Jian Xie and Li Zushu in their paper:
Jian Xie and Li Zushu, "Dynamic model and motion control analysis of three-link gymnastic robot on horizontal bar," in Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Robotics, Intelligent Systems and Signal Processing, vol. 1, 2003, IEEE.
