Hi there! I am Mahdi. I received dual B.Sc. degrees in Aerospace Engineering and Electrical Engineering, with a focus on dynamics and control, from Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic) in 2022. Currently, I am pursuing an M.Sc. degree in Aerospace Engineering at Sharif University of Technology, specializing in the development of a safe intelligent control system for an eVTOL air taxi.

I am interested in building intelligent autonomous systems that will benefit society. In order to achieve this long-term objective,  I believe we need learning-based, predictive and data-driven methods for decision-making and control that can be trusted to deliver reliable performance in complex real-world applications while ensuring safety.

**Research Interests:**
* Intelligent Autonomous Systems
* Learning-Based Control
* Model Predictive Control 
* Data-Driven Modeling and Control
* Resilient Flight Control
* Control of Multi-Agent Systems
