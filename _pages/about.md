Hi there! I am Mahdi. I received dual B.Sc. degrees in Electrical Engineering and Aerospace Engineering, with a focus on dynamic systems and control, from [Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic)](https://aut.ac.ir/en) in 2022. Currently, I am pursuing an M.Sc. degree in Dynamics and Control at [Sharif University of Technology](https://en.sharif.edu/), specializing in the development of a safe intelligent control system for an eVTOL air taxi.

I am interested in building assured autonomous systems that will benefit society. In order to achieve this long-term objective,  I believe we need learning-based, predictive and data-driven methods for planning, decision-making and control that can be trusted to deliver reliable performance in complex real-world applications while ensuring safety.

**Research Interests:**
* Assured Autonomous Systems and Robotics
* Safe Learning-Based Control
* Model Predictive Control 
* Data-Driven Modeling and Control
* Fault-Tolerant and Resilient Control
* Control of Multi-Agent Systems

In my spare time, I engage in sports like bodybuilding and running, as well as enjoying outdoor activities such as hiking, camping, and climbing with friends and family. Kickboxing used to be a part of my routine as well.

Thank you for visiting my website. Whether youâ€™re a fellow researcher, a prospective student, or simply curious about may work, I hope you find the information here helpful and motivating. Please feel free to [reach out](mailto:m.shahrajabian99@gmail.com) if you have any questions or would like to discuss potential collaborations.
