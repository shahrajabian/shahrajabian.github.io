Hi! I'm Mahdi, a control researcher passionate about control theory and its applications. Recently, I graduated with a masterâ€™s degree in Dynamics and Control at Sharif University of Technology, where I focused on developing safe control systems. I also hold dual B.Sc. degrees in Electrical and Aerospace Engineering from [Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic)](https://aut.ac.ir/), where I specialized in dynamic systems and control. 

My goal is to contribute to a safer and more sustainable society by designing systems that people can trust and rely on. To achieve this, I focus on data-driven methods for planning, decision-making, fault detection, and controlâ€”methods that ensure reliable performance in complex, real-world environments while prioritizing safety. Recently, I have concentrated on developing computationally efficient, data-driven algorithms capable of handling uncertain or unknown systems, while maintaining stability and keeping the system within safe operational limits, ultimately helping protect people and resources.
 More specifically, my research interests include:

<!-- **Research Interests:**-->
* Control Theory
* Data-Driven Modeling, Fault Diagnosis, and Control
* Safe Learning-Based Decision-Making and Control
* Multi-agent Systems

In my free time, I like to stay active with sports like bodybuilding and running, and I really enjoy outdoor adventures like hiking, camping, and climbing with friends and family. I used to do kickboxing too.

Thanks for stopping by my website! Whether you're a fellow researcher, a student exploring the field, or just curious about what I do, I hope you find something here that sparks your interest. Feel free to [reach out](mailto:m.shahrajabian99@gmail.com) if you have any questions or want to chat about possible collaborations!
