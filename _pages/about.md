Hi! I'm Mahdi, a control engineer and researcher passionate about control theory and its applications. Currently,  Iâ€™m working on my masterâ€™s in Dynamics and Control at [Sharif University of Technology](https://en.sharif.edu/), where Iâ€™m focusing on developing safe intelligent control systems for eVTOL air taxis. I also hold dual B.Sc. degrees in Electrical and Aerospace Engineering from [Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic)](https://aut.ac.ir/), where I specialized in dynamic systems and control. 


My aim is to contribute to the development of a sustainable society by advancing assured autonomous systems and optimizing their use. I picture a world where these systems completely transform transportation, healthcare, manufacturing, farming, renewable energy and disaster response, making each domain more efficient, precise, and adaptable. 

To achieve this long-term objective, I believe we need predictive and learning-based methods for planning, decision-making, and controlâ€”methods that can be trusted to deliver reliable performance in complex real-world applications while ensuring safety. Lately, Iâ€™ve been especially focused on developing computationally efficient, learning-based controllers that can handle uncertain or unknown systems, learn on the fly, and still keep the system stable and within safe limits. More specifically, my research interests include:

<!-- **Research Interests:**-->
* Model Predictive Control
* Safe Learning-Based Control
* Intelligent Decision-Making and Control
* Data-Driven Modeling and Control
* Safety-Critical Systems
* Assured Autonomous Systems and Robotics

In my free time, I like to stay active with sports like bodybuilding and running, and I really enjoy outdoor adventures like hiking, camping, and climbing with friends and family. I used to do kickboxing too.

Thanks for stopping by my website! Whether you're a fellow researcher, a student exploring the field, or just curious about what I do, I hope you find something here that sparks your interest. Feel free to [reach out](mailto:m.shahrajabian99@gmail.com) if you have any questions or want to chat about possible collaborations!
