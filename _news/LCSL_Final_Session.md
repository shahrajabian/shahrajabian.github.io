I am tremendously honored to have completed my first class as an instructor in the Linear Control Systems lab at Amirkabir University of Technology. This experience has been incredibly rewarding and has allowed me to further develop my teaching skills while delving deeper into applied control theory.
I am truly grateful to the students who entrusted me with their education. Additionally, I want to express my gratitude to the head of the laboratory, [Dr. Farzaneh Abdollahi](https://aut.ac.ir/cv/2149/FARZANEH%20ABDOLLAHI), for giving me the opportunity to teach this course.
