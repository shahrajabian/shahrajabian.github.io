I had the privilege of introducing control theory and its applications to the undergraduate electrical engineering students at Amirkabir University of Technology - Tehran Polytechnic. We explored the current and future directions of control systems and the significant challenges facing this field. It was exciting to engage with those eager to choose their major focus among the four main branches of electrical engineering: control, communication, electronics, and power.

As Steve Jobs once said, "𝗬𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝘄𝗼𝗿𝗸 𝗶𝘀 𝗴𝗼𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗼 𝗳𝗶𝗹𝗹 𝗮 𝗹𝗮𝗿𝗴𝗲 𝗽𝗮𝗿𝘁 𝗼𝗳 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗹𝗶𝗳𝗲, 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗼𝗻𝗹𝘆 𝘄𝗮𝘆 𝘁𝗼 𝗯𝗲 𝘁𝗿𝘂𝗹𝘆 𝘀𝗮𝘁𝗶𝘀𝗳𝗶𝗲𝗱 𝗶𝘀 𝘁𝗼 𝗱𝗼 𝘄𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗯𝗲𝗹𝗶𝗲𝘃𝗲 𝗶𝘀 𝗴𝗿𝗲𝗮𝘁 𝘄𝗼𝗿𝗸. 𝗔𝗻𝗱 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗼𝗻𝗹𝘆 𝘄𝗮𝘆 𝘁𝗼 𝗱𝗼 𝗴𝗿𝗲𝗮𝘁 𝘄𝗼𝗿𝗸 𝗶𝘀 𝘁𝗼 𝗹𝗼𝘃𝗲 𝘄𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗱𝗼." I hope to inspire these students to pursue their passions and find fulfillment in their chosen fields.
